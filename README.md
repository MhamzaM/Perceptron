# Perceptron
This project provides an overview of how a perceptron works. We have implemented a perceptron from scratch and have also provided optimized numpy code for each operation.

Dataset: Sonar Dataset (Binary classification problem)
Loss: Binary cross entropy loss
Optimizer: Batch Gradient Descent
